Tau Motors is a technology startup focused on developing software-defined 
power conversion systems designed to accelerate global electrification 
and reduce environmental impact. The company applies this core technology to 
build highly efficient, rare-earth-free powertrains (i.e. using electromagnets
on both rotor and stator sides instead of permanent magnets on one side), modular 
power converters, and advanced grid support systems that address complex global
motion, power, and energy demands.

### board development/testing

At Tau, I focused on the end-to-end development of PCBs for both motor power
electronics and bench-testing infrastructure. My hands-on work ranged from 
executing precision surface-mount and through-hole soldering to installing
components and validating system functionalities directly on the motor testbench.
In addition, I helped "quick-fix" board designs in KiCAD and streamlined
our PCB fabrication infrastructure.

_Due to a strict NDA, I cannot share specific photos or schematics of these boards._
_However, I am always happy to discuss the high-level engineering challenges and_
_problem-solving strategies involved in my work!_

### inventory system

Beyond PCB development, I architected and established Tau's comprehensive
inventory management system. I organized and documented our entire parts catalog,
migrating it into a custom Python-based platform I built from scratch. This 
centralized system streamlined stock tracking, eliminated supply bottlenecks,
and ultimately accelerated our hardware prototyping cycles.

Thank you to the whole Tau team for summers of philosophical debates, pineapples on 
pizza, and El Gru tacos. In particular, Greg Stevenson, Ethan Swint, and Nick Vasquez
taught me many engineering, organization, and life skills; thank you also to 
Zach Jones and Wes Pennington for allowing me the opportunity to work with such
a wonderful group!
