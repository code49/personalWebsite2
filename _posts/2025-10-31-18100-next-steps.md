### intro

Navigating the transition from introductory courses to a full Electrical and Computer 
Engineering degree can be overwhelming. As Head Teaching Assistant for Introduction 
to ECE (18-100), I recognized the need for stronger student support and completely 
overhauled our "Next Steps in ECE" workshop. I transformed the curriculum from a 
passive lecture into an interactive session, prioritizing personalized feedback and 
dedicated Q&A time to help students confidently map out their academic futures.

### presentation

A streamlined guide that breaks down the four core ECE pathways, explains how they branch into specializations, and provides practical strategies for time management and avoiding academic burnout.

perfectly fit 5 cm x 5 cm sticky notes available from Target!
