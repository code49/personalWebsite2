### intro

Navigating the transition from introductory courses to a full Electrical and Computer 
Engineering degree can be overwhelming. I recognized the need for stronger student engagement
and completely overhauled our "Next Steps in ECE" workshop, transforming the curriculum from a 
passive lecture into an interactive session, prioritizing personalized feedback and 
dedicated Q&A time to help students confidently map out their academic futures.

### presentation

This was designed as a streamlined guide that breaks down the four core ECE pathways, 
explains how they branch into specializations, and provides practical strategies for 
time management and avoiding academic burnout.

I also created a [degree planner sheet](% link _posts/2025-10-31-18100-planning-sheet.md%) 
as a part of this activity, so that students could visually map degree requirements 
and priorities.
