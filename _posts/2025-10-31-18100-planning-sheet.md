Degree planner sheet I created to help students map out their technical, capstone, 
and general education requirements in a clear, easy-to-digest format. Designed to
perfectly fit 5 cm x 5 cm sticky notes available from Target!

    <i>(Requirement listings based on CMU ECE's <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/academics/bs-in-ece/academic-guide.html">Academic Guide</a> as of October 2025)</i>
</p>

This sheet was originally developed as a part of an [18-100 recitation I designed
to prepare students for the next steps in ece]({% link _posts/2025-10-31-18100-next-steps.md %}),
though I hope it can remain useful for many others around the department! :)
