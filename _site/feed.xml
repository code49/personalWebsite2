<p>JustOneFlappyBird is a turing complete, one instruction set processor that can run the programming langugae SUBLEQ. As a demonstration of its functionality, we animated the video game Flappy Bird via VGA display. We targeted a <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/university-program/aup-boards/realdigital-boolean-board.html">Boolean Board</a> Xilinx Spartan 7 FPGA using SystemVerilog RTL, Synopsys VCS simulation, and Vivado synthesis. Our team of 4 built JustOneFlappyBird as a part of <a href="https://www.build18.org/">Build18</a> 2025, CMU ECE’s annual week-long hardware hackathon.</p>

<h3 id="subleq-briefly">SUBLEQ, Briefly</h3>

<p><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Subleq">SUBLEQ</a> is an esoteric programming language consisting of a single instruction, <strong>SUB</strong>tract and branch if <strong>L</strong>ess-than or <strong>EQ</strong>ual to zero. Instructions are of the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A B C</code> where A, B, and C are all memory addresses. The processor computes the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*B - *A</code> (* representing memory dereferences) and stores it back into B. If the result was less than or equal to 0, the PC jumps to C. That’s it!</p>

<h3 id="uniprocessor-design">Uniprocessor Design</h3>

  </kbd>
</p>

<p>Our processor consists of a PC register, two “general purpose” registers for collecting the value of operand A and operand B, and a register for saving the value of the memory address B for storing the result of the subtraction later. We used a 2-read-1-write memory (reading/writing B, as well as reading A or C), as well as a subtractor (calculating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*B - *A</code>) and comparator (checking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*B - *A &lt;= 0</code>).</p>

  </kbd>
</p>

<p>Our processor executes each SUBLEQ instruction in 8 cycles, or 5 primary steps (non-await-memory stages):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use PC and PC+1 to fetch addresses A and B</li>
  <li>Store address B into the B address register</li>
  <li>Read from addresses A and B to get *A and *B</li>
  <li>Store *A and *B into their respective registers, use PC+2 to fetch address C</li>
  <li>Save <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*B - *A</code> into address B, jump to address C if result is less than or equal to 0</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="graphics--vga">Graphics &amp; VGA</h3>

</p>

<p>Bird and pipe sprites where drawn via combinational logic. Each sprite was divided into “column 
groups” (sets of columns where each row had the same colors), which was then used in conjunction with
the current row to save us from having to write logic to set the color for each pixel individually!</p>

<p>Once we had a row/col –&gt; color assignment, we rendered it via a VGA engine we previously designed for
18-240’s Pong lab. Because the Boolean Board ultimately used a HDMI output, we used Xilinx IP to
convert our VGA into HDMI for display.</p>

<h3 id="system-architecture">System Architecture</h3>

<p>Our processor (and corresponding program memory) is connected via MMIO to the graphics modules “Draw Bird” 
and VGA. When the processor writes a value to a MMIO-reserved addreses, the Draw Bird module intercepts to
update the bird’s position on the screen and output to the VGA graphics engine.</p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>The Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute (BCHSI) is a division of the University of 
California San Francisco dedicated to applying computational tools to help solve medical
problems, from helping process sound data used to image living hearts to building models to
understand how genetics impact common diseases.</p>

<p>At UCSF, I worked on PHIlter, an open-source project dedicated to de-identifying clinical notes
(text documents doctors write during patient visits to note both quantitative and qualitative
observations). Through de-identifying these notes by removing personal health information (PHI, such as names, locations, dates, etc.), the data in these notes could be made more widely available for research study, all while protecting the privacy of patients.</p>

<h3 id="my-work">My Work</h3>

<p>My project revolved around creating a post-processing algorithm for PHIlter’s de-identified 
output. Initially, PHIlter simply marked each case of identifying information with a 
standardized tag (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[***NAME***]</code> where a patient’s name was listed) in the text. This could lead to issues of privacy in cases where PHIlter has a false-negative (i.e. fails to
detect a phrase as identifying information, as would happen roughly 1 percent of the time), as
the identity of the patient would be quickly revealed.</p>

  </kbd>
  <br /><i>Sample PHI replacement made by my algorithm! Dates were already de-identified in a way that preserved the relative timing of events.</i>
</p>

<p>I was charged with writing software to replace these censoring tags with randomized data, helping to hide these false-positives “in plain sight.” In order to keep the ‘camouflage’ intact, therefore, it was important to ensure that this data matched the context of the original identifying information.</p>

<p>My algorithm supported a host of identifying information types, from names to dates, phone 
numbers, even various random locations around the Bay Area. This project not only challenged
me in terms of complexity, but also in terms of scale. The program had to run over the i2b2
clinical notes test dataset, which contains nearly 2 million notes (and that was just the proof
of concept!), so efficiency and simplicity were key considerations, particularly as the size
of i2b2 pales in comparison to the number of clinical notes generated by the UCSF healthcare 
system, where PHIlter was intended to be used.</p>

<h3 id="other-learnings">Other Learnings</h3>

<p>Aside from using data libraries such as pandas and numpy on a large scale for the first time,
my time at UCSF also allowed me to get a first-hand look at the forefront of computational
biology research, as well as the dynamics within a large research institution such as UCSF.
It was fantastic seeing how the tools I had learned about in class translated into solving
real-world problems, and how a diverse group of developers, researchers, even doctors can come
together to work towards a collective end goal.</p>
