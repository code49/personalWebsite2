<h3>About</h3>

I am currently pursuing a combined B.S. (2026) and M.S. (2027) in Electrical and
Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. My work lives at the 
intersection of computer architecture, silicon design, and reconfigurable hardware, 
driven by a central goal: building systems that are as reliable as they are high-performance.<br><br>

I believe that "reliability" applies to more than just circuits or software. Whether I am 
bringing a complex architecture from concept to silicon or leading a technical team, I 
focus on creating resilient frameworks - both in the hardware I design and the collaborative 
environments I help build.<br><br>

This site is meant to serve as a showcase of some of the publically-shareable work I've done, places 
I've been, and wonderful people I've met!
